I am a third-year PhD Student in Economics at the [EHESS](https://www.ehess.fr/fr/), hosted by the Labor Chair of [Paris School of Economics](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/fr/). I am working under the supervision of [Philippe Askenazy](http://www.jourdan.ens.fr/~askenazy/).

My work is predominantly in labor economics, with secondary interests in public and education economics. In particular, I am interested in topics related to working time, from the measurement of hours worked to their role in labor market dynamics and broader economic research. Most of my research involves linking survey and administrative data to combine rich sets of variables with panel data structure.
