I am a **PhD Student** in Economics at the [EHESS](https://www.ehess.fr/fr/), hosted by the Labor Chair of [Paris School of Economics](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/fr/). I am working under the supervision of [Philippe Askenazy](https://cmh.ens.fr/author/philippe-askenazy/).

My work is predominantly in labor economics and applied econometrics, with secondary interests in public and education economics. In particular, I am interested in topics related to **working time**, from the measurement of hours worked to their impact on labor market dynamics and broader economic issues.

Most of my research also involves linking survey and administrative data to combine rich sets of variables with panel data structure. 

I will be visiting the **University of British Columbia** in Spring 2026, sponsored by [Raffaele Saggio](https://sites.google.com/site/raffaelesaggio/).
